# Custom STRING Class Implementation in C++

## Project Overview
This mini project implements a Custom STRING Class in C++ without using the Standard Library `std::string`.
  
The objective of this project is to understand low-level string manipulation, dynamic memory allocation, and operator overloading by building a string class from scratch using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

---

## Features Implemented
The project includes the following features:
- Default constructor, parameterized constructor, and copy constructor
- Dynamic memory management using `new` and `delete`
- Operator overloading for common string operations
- Manual implementation of common string functions without using std::string
- Demonstration of `Rule of Three` in C++

---

## Operators Implemented
The following operators are overloaded in the STRING class:
- Assignment operator (=)
- Concatenation operator (+)
- Subscript operator ([])
- Stream insertion operator (<<)
- Stream extraction operator (>>)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)

---

## String Functions Implemented
The following string manipulation functions are implemented using friend functions:

Strcpy  
Strncpy  
Strcmp  
Strncmp  
Strcat  
Strncat  
Strrev  
Strupper  
Strlower  
Strchr  
Strrchr  
Strstr  
Strlen  

---

## Concepts Used
This project uses the following C++ concepts:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Operator overloading
- Friend functions
- Character array manipulation
- Rule of Three (Constructor, Copy Constructor, Destructor)

---

## Project Files
The project consists of the following files:
- header.h : Contains the STRING class definition
- friend.cpp : Contains implementation of string functions
- main.cpp : Test and demonstration program
- Makefile : Build instructions
- README.md : Project documentation

---

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and execute the project using Makefile, run the following commands:

make  
./myString  

To compile and run manually without Makefile, use:

g++ main.cpp friend.cpp -o myString  
./myString  

---

## Working Description
The STRING class internally manages a dynamically allocated character array.  
User input is accepted using the overloaded extraction (>>) operator and output is displayed using the insertion (<<) operator.

All string operations such as copying, concatenation, comparison, searching, and case conversion are implemented manually without using the C++ Standard Library string class.  
This project helps in understanding how strings work internally in C++.

---

## Applications
This project can be used for:
- Academic mini projects
- Learning core C++ programming concepts
- Understanding internal working of strings
- Interview preparation for C++ fundamentals
- Practicing memory management and OOP concepts
